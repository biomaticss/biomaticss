# 🚀 Welcome to Biomaticss's Intergalactic Lab! 🧪

*“Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!”*  
Hey, I'm Biomaticss, a biochem master from Sun Yat-sen University, navigating the multiverse of bioinformatics and antibody discovery. This is my portal to awesome projects, powered by Rick-level genius and Morty-level curiosity. Strap in for some science!

## 🧬 About Me
- **Species**: Human (probably, unless I'm a clone from Dimension C-137)
- **Mission**: Building pipelines for antibody discovery and decoding the universe’s genetic mysteries.
- **Tools in My Portal Gun**: Python, R, NGS analysis, ELISA, PCR, and a dash of chaos.
- **Current Adventure**: Bioinformatics analyst at a biotech company at GuangZhou, fighting low w*ges with high vibes.

## 🌌 Featured Projects
Here’s some stuff I built in my garage lab. No Meeseeks were harmed.

- **[Antibody Discovery Pipeline](https://github.com/biomaticss/Antibody-Discovery-Pipeline)**  
  A Python-based pipeline for analyzing antibody sequences. Built to impress Mr. Poopybutthole.  
  *Tech*: Pandas, Biopython, BLAST  
  *Status*: *In progress, like Rick’s sobriety.*

- **[Protein Structure Prediction](https://github.com/biomaticss/Protein-Structure-Prediction)**  
  Used AlphaFold to predict protein structures. Morty would call it "cool science stuff."  
  *Tech*: AlphaFold, PyMOL  
  *Status*: *Done, baby!*

- **[NGS Data Cruncher](https://github.com/biomaticss/NGS-Data-Cruncher)**  
  A script to process NGS data faster than Rick escaping the Galactic Federation.  
  *Tech*: R, Bash, AWS  
  *Status*: *Ready for interdimensional travel.*

## 🎉 Fun Facts
- I once debugged a Python script while binge-watching *Interdimensional Cable*.  
- My favorite Rick invention? The portal gun, obviously.  
- Ask me about my theory on why Morty’s always stressed.
